# Go Telegram Bot by ImBIOS

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FImBIOS%2Fgo-telegram-bot%2Ftree%2Fmaster)

I just learn Golang with fun project. like this Chuck Norris joke bot.

## Prerequisite:

Define the `botToken` environment variable in the vercel deployment settings.

Use `github.com/joho/godotenv` if you want to use environment variable file.

Just access the env variable if you use vercel and already defined the variable there.
